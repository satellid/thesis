Knowledge in human perspective mostly always defined as the thinking foundation within everyday life,
especially when people think and remember their daily personal knowledge.
Daily personal knowledge are things like details, facts, or in context of personal profiles, companies, products, places, events, and others.
People use mostly their own brain for storing them, then retrieve and recall that in their own memory when they needed.

One of way to manage those kinds of knowledge is using knowledge management.
Knowledge management is the most suitable or de facto way to help manage them.
A tool or system is needed because the brain mostly cannot handle tons of them all quickly and safely with no help.
The tools are ranging from analog form like pen and paper, to digital form like software or database
The system can be as simple as writing the knowledge onto an analog tools, further as complex as storing the knowledge into a digital tools.

Unfortunately, the problems of managing those knowledge are often remain troublesome still.
Furthermore for people who manage tons of them repeatedly overtimes daily.
When there are tons of them and lots of various of them that must be managed, they canâ€™t be handled with just regular tools.
Especially when the knowledge are unstructured and can be freely out of topic, or has some wide different variety of contexts.

Knowledge management itself is sometimes ironically difficult to understand and even misunderstood in most of the society.
Kind of viewed that information with note taking apps are sometimes enough to be a knowledge manager.
While actually it can be understand with the process that beyond of information taking.
Unlike information taking that too specific and few time use (only the what, when, where), knowledge management is more into understanding and collective notion that can be used everytime (the what, why, and how).
Most of the apps or systems are only storing and managing temporary information and designed for specific needs, so often you may forgot it and need different tools.

There were a lot of attempt to store knowledge by using an software that is designed just for data, information, or note taking.
System or application that are only storing and managing temporary information and designed for too much general purpose.
So frequently often you may forgot what inside it, need different tools, or can only open the content properly with that specific software.
Because basically, what inside them are not all belong to the user.
For example when using Wikipedia, Google Docs, or Evernote, there could be an encounter to those frequently often problems.
All things inside those tools or systems, are affiliated with others' data or another system that its contents not fully known by the user.
%The content can be stuck and too much dependent on it, whereas deep down essentially those are just text files.
Moreover, the data footprint are mostly bloated in their file formats.
Because at first they're designed as a free form database, so users can do whatever with it as unstructured system.
The result is more often to be very cluttered, because there is no structure frame of context.
Despite of that, they're still the most usable tools and system because they're currently have the most needed features for people.
Meanwhile most of the solutions offered today still have inherent styles of traditional analog notes.
That means note taking applications just digitalize the basic nature of real world notes and books, while making it faster and organized in one place.

Some people know they need to have the best way to manage their daily knowledge or memory, they want to help enhance or extend their knowledge or memory of their need, and they should have that best tool or system then make their life better.
So there should be the simplest and easiest way to manage knowledge whereever.
That's why existing tools should not be slow, heavy, bloated, ineffective, vendor locked-in, and anti cross-platform.
Therefore there is a need for a single system that can adapts into various kinds of purpose in terms of managing and collecting knowledge, information, or data.
A need for a full-fledged natural system rather than just digital software application.
Because managing knowledge with bookmarks, notes, todo lists, wiki, and visual dependent approach are often messy and very limited in storing various type of data.
Also too many different softwares to do just their own solution for different problems, while actually have the same basic underlying principle in managing data, information, or knowledge.
So then the essential knowledge are mostly separated into too many softwares.
In more depth, those exists across different documents, applications, and systems.
With another case, people take analog notes of knowledge in just a form of notebooks.
But text notes that only located in one place are not easy to handle if there are tons of contents with various contexts.
There are digital systems and services, but majority of them remain usable just when online only and stuck within proprietary system.
Also their kinds are usually too specific, leading to more apps needed to do something that is related but outside the functionality.
After all if what a person want to manage is their knowledge, they should use a knowledge manager which cover the various essentials that are known to them.

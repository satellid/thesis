\section{Document Database}
\label{sec:document-database}

Because the software is going to use \ac{NoSQL} database technology that specifically is a document database, there will be options to choose, at least one of the main database that will be used.
Some of the popular document databases \ac{NoSQL} with document-oriented database are MongoDB and CouchDB.

\subsection{MongoDB}

MongoDB\index{MongoDB} (can also be called just Mongo\index{Mongo|see{MongoDB}}), created by MongoDB Inc. (previously named 10gen), is one of the leading document database used today.
Mongo is a \ac{JSON}\index{JSON} document database, though technically data is stored in a binary form or representation of \ac{JSON} known as \ac{BSON}.
A Mongo document can be likened to a relational table row without a schema, whose values can nest to an arbitrary depth.~\autocite{Redmond:2012:DB:MongoDB}

In Mongo, there are some simple concepts that used:

\begin{easylist}
  & Can have zero or more databases
  & Database can ontain collections.
  & Collections can contain documents
  & Document consist of fields.
  & Indexes are to point the data fields.
  & Cursors are the returned temporary data.
\end{easylist}

To summarize, MongoDB is made up of databases which contain collections.
A collection is made up of documents. Each document is made up of fields.
Collections can be indexed, which improves lookup and sorting performance.
Finally, the data that got from MongoDB go through a cursor whose actual execution is delayed until necessary.~\autocite{Seguin2010MongoDB}
Listing \autoref{lst:mongo-sample} is an example of how data in Mongo looks, represented in \ac{JSON}.

\end{listing}

MongoDB has many advantages over others because of its:

\begin{easylist}
& Agile Capability
& Flexible Data Model
& MongoDB's document data model makes it easy for you to store data of any structure and dynamically modify the schema.
& High Scalability
& High Performance
& Expressive Query Language
& Fastest-Growing Community
\end{easylist}

\subsection{CouchDB}
\label{ssec:couchdb}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}

  \vspace{-20pt}

\end{wrapfigure}

Other alternative available for \ac{NoSQL} is CouchDB\index{CouchDB}, created by The Apache Software Foundation, a relaxing and very flexible document database built of the web that mostly used for storage system.
It actually can be planned to be used as the main database, but regarding to the framework of choice that later will be discussed, only MongoDB that can be used for now.
The data content itself is not very different with MongoDB.
